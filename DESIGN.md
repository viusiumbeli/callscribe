# CallScribe — design

Local call transcription for macOS. The name `callscribe` is a working title.

## Problem

Taking notes during calls by hand is distracting. We need a desktop app that records
a call, transcribes it, and produces a summary with an action-item checklist.
Speech recognition must run strictly on-device, no network.

## Requirements

- **Languages**: Russian (primary) and English; auto-detect with manual override.
- **Modes**: live draft during the call + accurate final pass afterwards (live is
  not part of the MVP).
- **Output**: transcript with timecodes and per-speaker attribution — me plus each
  remote participant distinguished (`Speaker 1/2/3`), with names inferred from
  conversation context by the LLM where possible; summary, agreements, a
  "what I must do" checklist; Markdown export; call history.
- **Platform**: macOS only (Apple Silicon).
- **Privacy**: STT and diarization are fully offline. Summaries in v1 go through the
  locally installed `claude -p`: the transcript text is sent to the Anthropic API
  (a deliberate trade-off). The Summarizer interface allows plugging in Ollama later
  for a 100% offline setup.

## Key decisions

1. **Native Swift** (SwiftUI, menubar app), single process. macOS-only removes the
   cross-platform audio-capture pain; ScreenCaptureKit and CoreML with no glue layers.
2. **Two separate audio tracks**: microphone (me) via AVAudioEngine, system audio
   (other participants) via a Core Audio process tap (`AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`
   + aggregate device, macOS 14.4+; AudioCap pattern). "Me vs others" attribution
   comes from the channel split — zero ML, no voice overlap between the two tracks.
   *(Changed from ScreenCaptureKit at planning stage: SCK requires the Screen
   Recording TCC with monthly re-approval nags on macOS 15+ and can't run truly
   video-free; taps use the plain Audio Recording permission. A tap-backed
   aggregate device can't be read via AVAudioEngine — IOProc callbacks only.)*
3. **WhisperKit** as the STT engine: live draft via streaming on a small model
   (base/small), final pass in batch mode on `large-v3-turbo`, each track separately.
   A second engine is user-selectable from the tray: **NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3**
   (FluidAudio's CoreML port — the diarizer dependency already ships it), several-fold
   faster at a third of the disk/memory, multilingual incl. Russian, token timings at
   80 ms granularity feeding the same merge. Whisper stays the default: it is stronger
   on code-switched ru/en speech and reports the detected language (Parakeet doesn't).
   The `SpeechTranscriber` protocol keeps the pipeline and dictation engine-agnostic;
   the choice is stored in UserDefaults (`stt.engine`) and applies to new work only —
   meta.json records which model transcribed each call.
4. **Diarization of remote participants**: pyannote *community-1* via Argmax
   SpeakerKit (on-device CoreML: powerset segmentation → WeSpeaker embeddings →
   VBx clustering) — chosen by verified research (DER 20.2% on DIHARD III, the
   best open cascaded pipeline) after the previous-generation FluidAudio models
   kept merging quiet participants into the dominant cluster; the exact-count
   hint now genuinely constrains clustering. FluidAudio stays as the voice
   LIBRARY's embedding space (matching, relabeling, enrollment re-embed
   cluster centroids per call), so profiles survived the migration unchanged —
   and as the Parakeet ASR provider. Known limits: labels are anonymous (not
   names), and boundaries degrade on overlapping speech and similar voices. The
   diarizer cuts on model frames, so before attribution each boundary between
   different-speaker spans is snapped to the nearest inter-word silence of the
   Whisper transcription (word timings are the finer signal; speakers change
   between words, not mid-word) — reply edges stop stealing each other's words.
5. **Speaker names via the LLM**: the Summarizer prompt maps speaker labels to real
   names from conversation context ("Thanks, Misha" → Speaker 2 = Misha) —
   best-effort; manual rename in the UI is the fallback. The mapping is stored in
   `meta.json` and applied to the transcript. The same reply carries turn-level
   *speaker corrections* — lines whose attribution is clearly wrong in context
   (an answer credited to the person who asked it). Applied conservatively:
   only between remote speakers (never "Me" — the mic track is ground truth),
   and only when both the turn's timecode and its current label match. Stored
   in `meta.json` with labels canonicalized ("Speaker 2", never a display
   name, so renames can't strand them) and each entry keyed by the turn's
   original speaker (chains collapse, exact reverts cancel — replay order
   never matters). They survive every re-render; cleared when diarization
   re-runs and on Trim, whose new spans/timecodes they no longer describe.
   A per-project `context.md` (glossary, people, terms — the toolbar's
   Context button) rides along in the same prompt: the LLM uses its canonical
   spellings and returns `replacements` — literal "misheard → canonical" text
   fixes, applied at render time and content-keyed, so they survive trims and
   even a re-transcription that repeats the same mistake.
6. **Audio is the source of truth**: written to disk continuously from the first
   second; the transcript can always be regenerated. An app crash never loses a call.
7. **Storage is plain folders, no DB**; Markdown is indexed by Spotlight (search for free).
8. **Dictation on Right Shift, hold-to-talk.** Held rather than latched, so a
   stuck session is structurally impossible. Right Shift is a *typing* key, which
   is the whole risk: guarded by a 350 ms hold threshold (ordinary shift-typing
   never crosses it), by cancelling outright when any other key or modifier goes
   down during the hold, and by never arming under a chord. Those three rules live
   in a pure `DictationGesture` state machine so they're unit-tested rather than
   hand-verified. Nothing ever consumes the keystroke — swallowing it would break
   capital letters system-wide.
8b. **The hold is detected by polling `CGEventSource`, not by an event monitor.**
   `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` is the obvious implementation and it
   **breaks the app** on macOS 26: with one installed, this process stops
   receiving its own mouse events — clicks go to whatever is behind our windows,
   the tray menu won't open, and no window becomes key, all while the app renders
   correctly and its main thread sits idle. It presents as a total UI freeze, and
   took a long bisection to attribute (0 clicks delivered with the monitor
   installed; 6 in as many seconds without it). So the watcher polls at 20 Hz:
   `flagsState` for Right Shift via the *device-dependent* bit `0x04` (both
   `NSEvent.modifierFlags` and `keyState(kVK_RightShift)` are useless here — the
   former is device-independent, the latter reports modifiers under the left key
   code), and `secondsSinceLastEventType(.keyDown)` to recover the
   "you were typing" abort. No event tap, and **observing needs no Accessibility
   grant** — only posting the paste does.
9. **Insertion by clipboard + synthetic ⌘V**, not the Accessibility API.
   Setting `kAXSelectedTextAttribute` is tidier but fails silently in too many of
   the places people type (Electron apps, terminals, most web views); ⌘V is what
   they all implement. The clipboard is snapshotted and restored, and the
   synthetic event uses a `.privateState` source so it can't inherit the Right
   Shift the user has just this moment been holding (⌘⇧V is a different command).
   Where posting is impossible — untrusted, or secure input on a password field —
   the text is left on the clipboard rather than dropped.
10. **Dictation keeps its own warm model instance**, separate from the pipeline's.
   Sharing one would park a two-second dictation behind an hour-long call
   transcription; the cost is both resident while a call processes, bounded by a
   10-minute idle release. The load is kicked off when recording *starts*, so the
   first-use cost overlaps the user's speech instead of following it. Dictation
   stands down entirely while a call records — one microphone, and the call wins.
11. **Echo cancellation before transcription, offline.** The mic track contains
   the remote voices bleeding in through the speakers, which the mic-side
   transcript would attribute to "Me". Apple's real-time voice processing
   removes the echo but muffles the voice; instead the pipeline runs SpeexDSP's
   adaptive filter (vendored C sources) *after* the call, using the system
   track as the clean far-end reference — possible only because both tracks
   are recorded separately and time-aligned. Falls back to the raw mic if
   either input is unusable.
12. **A persistent voice library, matched one-to-one.** Enrolling a speaker
   stores their voice embedding (`voices.json`); later calls get names
   automatically. Matching happens at the speaker level, not FluidAudio's loose
   per-segment matching (which over-matches similar voices), and assignment is
   greedy one-to-one — a wrong name is worse than a missed match.
   The primary way voices get learned is per-utterance annotation: speaker
   labels in the transcript are clickable, the user names a few turns ("this
   piece of voice is Ilia") and applies — those marks are ground truth.
   `SpanRelabeler` (pure, unit-tested) then reassigns every diarization span:
   an annotated span keeps its mark unconditionally; a cluster annotated with
   one name inherits it wholesale; a cluster annotated with several names (the
   diarizer merged people) splits per-span by voice; unannotated clusters get
   a name only within the strict distance threshold. The voices land in the
   library (with an audible WAV sample — the People screen lists them), so
   future calls are named automatically.
13. **Calls are grouped into projects** — arbitrary folders the user picks; a
   "Default" project pointing at `~/Documents/CallNotes` keeps old recordings
   working. Processing runs in the background so the next call can start
   recording immediately, and a Trim tool cuts dead air off a recording and
   re-runs the pipeline (user corrections — title, speaker names — survive).
   A call recorded into the wrong project moves to another one (folder move,
   collision-suffixed; blocked while the pipeline holds it), and Re-transcribe
   redoes everything from the words up with the currently selected engine.
14. **Capture survives route changes.** Bluetooth headsets switch away and flip
   profiles (A2DP↔HFP) mid-call, and each flip can change the stream's sample
   rate — wrapping tap buffers with a stale format is how a 40-minute call
   once produced a half-speed system track. Three layers defend against it:
   the tap's stream format lives behind a lock and is refreshed by a property
   listener (the IOProc re-reads it per callback); TrackSink re-creates its
   resampler whenever a buffer's format changes; and a default-output-device
   listener rebuilds the tap + aggregate on the new route while the mic engine
   restarts on `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange`. Holes left while capture
   was down are padded with silence, keeping the two tracks sample-aligned
   for the echo canceller. The watchdog escalates per track (`StallDetector`,
   a pure unit-tested state machine): restart the stalled track's capture,
   abandon it after three failed restarts and continue on the other track —
   a mic-only transcript beats none — and end the session only when both are
   dead, reporting whether audio stopped arriving or writes started failing
   (a latched disk error used to masquerade as a "capture stall").

```

- **AudioRecorder** — two WAV/CAF tracks, 16 kHz mono, continuous writes to disk.
- **Transcriber** — live: mixed signal → ring buffer → WhisperKit streaming (draft,
  no attribution). Final: each track separately with word timestamps.
- **Diarizer** — runs on the system-audio track, produces time-ranged speaker
  clusters; merge step snaps cluster edges to inter-word silences, then aligns
  Whisper segments with clusters by time overlap →
  `[00:12:34] Me: … / Speaker 2: …`.
- **Summarizer** — a "transcript → markdown" protocol + prompt template (summary,
  agreements, "my tasks" checklist, speaker-name mapping, turn-level speaker
  corrections). Implementation #1 shells out to `claude -p`.

macOS permissions: Microphone + System Audio Recording (`NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription`,
required by the Core Audio tap) — onboarding flow on first launch. No Screen
Recording permission needed.

## Data flow

During the call:
1. ● Rec → both captures start; audio hits the disk immediately.
2. Mixed signal → live draft in the window (marked as "draft").
3. Live degrades gracefully: if the model can't keep up, the draft lags; disk
   recording is never affected (priority #1).

After Stop:
4. Final STT pass per track; diarization on the system track; merge by time overlap
   → `transcript.md` with `Me / Speaker N` labels.
5. Transcript → Summarizer → `summary.md` + inferred speaker names + turn-level
   speaker corrections; both are applied to the transcript, manual rename
   available in the UI.
6. Window shows transcript + summary; "copy / export / open folder" actions.

## Storage

```
~/Documents/CallNotes/2026-07-14_15-30/
  mic.wav  system.wav  transcript.md  summary.md  meta.json
```

`meta.json` holds call metadata, the speaker-label → name mapping (inferred or
manually set), and the LLM's turn-level speaker corrections. In-app history = a
listing of this folder. Setting: "delete audio
after successful transcription".

## Error handling

- Permission revoked / capture died mid-call → per-track restarts first; the
  session ends (with everything recorded so far kept) only when both tracks
  are beyond recovery, and the log says which failure mode it was.
- No `claude` CLI / no network → transcript is still produced and saved (with
  anonymous speaker labels); the summary has a "retry" button. Transcription and
  diarization never depend on summarization.
- Diarization failure → transcript falls back to `Me / Participant` labels; the
  call is not lost.
- First launch → model download (Whisper ~1.5 GB + small model + diarization models)
  with a progress bar.
- Low disk space → checked before recording starts.

## Testing

- Unit: merge logic — aligning word-timestamped Whisper segments with diarization
  clusters across two tracks (the core logic of the app).
- Unit: capture resilience — the watchdog's escalation rules (`StallDetector`)
  and TrackSink's format-following resampler + timeline gap padding, driven
  with synthetic buffers and host times.
- Golden test of the pipeline on a short two-track ru+en fixture with two remote
  speakers.
- Summarizer is mocked in tests (including the name-mapping response).
- Audio capture — manual smoke test (not verifiable in CI).
- Dictation: the Right Shift gesture is a pure state machine and unit-tested
  exhaustively (it decides what happens on every keystroke, so a regression here
  would be felt system-wide). The dictation log's format is tested too, and the
  timestamp-free decode path against the golden speech fixture (opt-in, needs the
  model). The hotkey monitor, the overlay panel and the synthetic ⌘V are all
  manual — none can be exercised without a real keyboard and a focused app.

## Phases

1. **MVP**: record two tracks → final transcript (me + Speaker 1/2/3, timecodes) →
   diarization → summary + checklist + name inference via claude → export/history.
   No live.
2. Live draft.
3. Polish: history search, audio auto-delete, Ollama backend.

## Verify at planning stage

Knowledge snapshot is early 2026: before implementation, check current docs for the
exact WhisperKit APIs (streaming, word timestamps), ScreenCaptureKit (audio-only
capture, current permission model on macOS 15+), and FluidAudio (diarization API,
model licensing).

*Verified 2026-07-14.* WhisperKit now ships inside the Argmax OSS SDK
(`github.com/argmaxinc/argmax-oss-swift`, v1.0.0, MIT); word timestamps and ru/en
auto-detect confirmed. FluidAudio v0.15.x confirmed (Apache 2.0; pyannote-derived
CoreML models are CC-BY-4.0). ScreenCaptureKit was replaced with Core Audio process
taps — see decision #2. Build system: SwiftPM only (no Xcode; CommandLineTools
toolchain), `.app` bundle assembled by the Makefile and signed with a local
self-signed certificate so TCC grants persist across rebuilds.

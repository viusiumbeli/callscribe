/// Watches for the Right Shift hold and reports what it means.
///
/// Deliberately thin: every decision lives in `DictationGesture`, which is pure
/// and tested. This file is only the polling and the clock, neither of which can
/// be unit-tested.
///
/// **Why polling and not `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents`.** The obvious
/// implementation — a global monitor for `.flagsChanged`/`.keyDown` — breaks the
/// app. On macOS 26, installing one stops this process receiving its **own mouse
/// events**: clicks on our windows are delivered elsewhere, the tray menu won't
/// open, and no window ever becomes key, all while the app renders correctly and
/// its main thread sits idle. It looks exactly like a frozen UI and took a long
/// time to pin down. Measured: with the global monitor installed, a local mouse
/// monitor logged 0 clicks; with dictation disabled, 6 in as many seconds.
///
/// So this reads key state directly instead, via `CGEventSource`, which needs no
/// event tap and no Accessibility grant:
///
/// - `flagsState(_:)` — Right Shift down *specifically*, from the
///   device-dependent bits. `NSEvent`'s `.shift` is device-independent and can't
///   tell the two shift keys apart, and `keyState(_:key:)` is no help either: for
///   modifier keys it reports the press under the *left* key code whichever
///   physical key you use. Same call also answers "is a chord modifier held?".
/// - `secondsSinceLastEventType(_:eventType:)` — did the user type a key during
///   the hold? That's the "you were shifting, not dictating" abort, recovered
///   without seeing the keystroke itself.
///
/// Posting the paste still needs Accessibility; observing no longer does.

        You are given a transcript of a call. Speakers are labeled "Me" and \
        "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc. Produce a concise Markdown summary in the \
        same language as the transcript, with these sections:

        ## Summary
        A short paragraph of what the call was about.

        ## Agreements
        Bullet list of decisions and agreements reached.

        ## My tasks
        A checklist (`- [ ]`) of concrete action items assigned to "Me".

        REQUIRED: end your reply with a fenced ```json block (and nothing after \
        it) containing a "title" — 3–6 words naming the call, in the \
        transcript's language — and a "speakers" object mapping labels to any \
        real names you can confidently infer (use {} if none). Always include \
        the "title". Example:

        ```json
        {"title": "Launch planning sync", "speakers": {"Speaker 1": "Misha"}}
        ```

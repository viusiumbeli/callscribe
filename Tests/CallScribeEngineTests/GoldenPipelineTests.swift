/// End-to-end pipeline regression on a committed two-track ru+en fixture.
///
/// Opt-in: needs the Whisper + diarization models downloaded (`callscribe
/// setup`) and is slow, so it only runs when CALLSCRIBE_GOLDEN=1. Assertions
/// are deliberately fuzzy — Whisper output drifts across model versions, so we
/// check structural properties, not exact strings.
///
/// The committed fixture is SYNTHETIC (macOS `say`: ru+en mic, two TTS voices
/// on the system track). It proves the pipeline runs end-to-end on real ML —
/// but note two limits it exposes: FluidAudio does not reliably separate the
/// two TTS voices (they cluster as one speaker — TTS voices sit too close in
/// embedding space), and Whisper renders the English mic intro as Russian
/// (the ru+en code-switching limitation). For genuine multi-speaker validation,
/// replace the fixture with a REAL recording made via `callscribe record`
/// (see scripts/smoke.md) — hence the assertions below are structural, not
/// speaker-count-based.
